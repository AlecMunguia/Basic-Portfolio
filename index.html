            I'm Alec! I am a part-time coding student (though I would hardly call it part time) and a full-time Operations Coordinator for Do512. I love musical instruments and effects, technology, psychology books, and my dog Pup. Pup is my two year old Shiba Inu (@atxpup on Instagram). I've been told that he is far more handsome than I am. I thought that was an unneccessary comment to make to someone during a first conversation. They clearly thought otherwise.
            <br/><br/><br/><br/>
            I got a Business Administration degree from Texas State University in 2015 and have since been working at Do512. I love the company and working with live music, but fun doesn't pay the bills. ...or provide insurance... So I am pursuing my other passion, technology.
            <br/><br/><br/><br/>
            I hope in the future I will be able to fill this last section of bio with lists of apps, websites, and fancily-named projects (like burgr or boinkify), but for now a self-depricating meta narrative will have to do.
